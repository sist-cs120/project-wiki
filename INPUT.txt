Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, 
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, 
doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and 
thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again 
this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, 
as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
That's all and
this is the last line.
